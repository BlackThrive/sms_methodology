# Black Thrive Shared Measurement System Methodology
 
## Overview

This Rproject contains the scripts and data necessary to produce the methodology paper supporting Black Thrive's Shared Measurement System for Lambeth, Haringey, and Birmingham. It outlines in detail the data processing and analysis procedures and results that yield each of the Shared Measurement Systems. 

The aim of the Shared Measurement System project is to quantify racial inequality in Britain by comparing various indicators for the Black population with the White population. Doing so makes it possible to identify the aspects of life in Britain where inequality is manifest and to highlight where change is needed.
